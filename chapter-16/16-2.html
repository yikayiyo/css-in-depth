				<h4>Mrs. Featherstone</h4>
				<p>
					She may be a bit frumpy, but Mrs Featherstone gets the job done. She
					lays her largish cream-colored eggs on a daily basis. She is
					gregarious to a fault.
				</p>
				<p>This Austra White is our most prolific producer.</p>

				<h4>Hen Solo</h4>
				<p>
					Though the most recent addition to our flock, Hen Solo is a fast
					favorite among our laying brood. She is a sassy and suspicious hen; we
					frequently have to follow her to find where she has hidden her loot
					from the other hens.
				</p>
				<p>
					This Snowy Easter Egger lays in delicate shades of blue and green. A
					full dozen of her eggs costs an additional $2.

				<h4>Cluck Norris</h4>
				<p>
					Every brood has its brawler. Cluck Norris is our feistiest hen,
					frequently picking fights with other hens about laying territory and
					foraging space. Her sister hens continue to hope that she will follow
					the steps of her namesake (eventually) and focus the her strength of
					will for good.
				</p>
				<p>
					This Buff Chantecler is as robust and hardy as her Canadian forebears,
					laying through the coldest parts of the winter.
				</p>

				<h4>Peggy Schuyler</h4>
				<p>
					Peggy was our first and friendliest hen. She is the most likely to
					greet visitors to the yard, and frequently to be found nesting in the
					coop. Though not a prolific layer, her output is consistent and
					regular. You will regularly find her eggs among your dozen.
				</p>
				<p>This Lavender Orpington lays light brown eggs.</p>
